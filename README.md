Single Image Reflection Removal based on GAN with Gradient Constraint

|Input real image|Image generated by our method|
|:--:|:--:|
|<img src="Util/input.png" width=70%>|<img src="Util/output.png" width=70%>|

The sample image is provided by [SIR<sup>2</sup> benchmark dataset](https://sir2data.github.io/).

## Usage
Our code is based on Pytorch. Put input images into `images/<dataset_name>/input`. Processed images are saved in `images/<dataset_name>/output`. 

If you have ground truth images, put them into `images/<dataset_name>/gt`. PSNR and SSIM will be calculated. The file name of ground truth images should match with those of input images.

run `python3 demo.py`
